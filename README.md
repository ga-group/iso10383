ISO10383 (MIC)
==============

This repository is an RDF view on ISO10383's MICs in the [fibo-fbc-fct-mkti namespace](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/FunctionalEntities/MarketsIndividuals/).

Why?
----

FIBO's official ontology lacks historical identifiers and, consequently, annotations
about their temporal validity.
